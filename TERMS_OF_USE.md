# Terms of Use for Minovative Mind VS Code Extension

## Last Updated: February 1, 2026

## 1. Introduction and Acceptance of Terms

Welcome to the Minovative Mind VS Code Extension ("Minovative Mind" or "the Extension"), a powerful AI coding agent designed to enhance your development workflow within Visual Studio Code. These Terms of Use ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the Minovative Mind extension provided by Ward Innovations DBA ("we," "us," or "our").

By installing, accessing, or using the Minovative Mind extension, you agree to be bound by these Terms, our [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md), our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), and the [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE.md) under which the core software is distributed. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Extension.

## 2. Description of the Minovative Mind Extension

Minovative Mind is an open-source AI agent that automates various aspects of software development. It leverages advanced AI models (specifically the Google Gemini API, which requires your own API key) to assist with tasks such as generating code, planning projects, fixing issues, explaining code, and automating Git operations. The Extension processes local user data and interacts with external AI APIs using user-provided keys.

## 3. User Responsibilities

As a user of the Minovative Mind extension, you agree to the following responsibilities:

### 3.1 API Key Management and Costs

You are solely responsible for obtaining, securing, and managing your own Google Gemini API key. Ward Innovations DBA does not store, transmit, or have access to your API key, which is managed exclusively by VS Code’s secure SecretStorage API on your local machine. You are responsible for all costs and usage associated with your Google Gemini API key, and for complying with Google’s own terms of service and privacy policies for their AI services.

### 3.2 Responsibility for Input and Output

You are solely responsible for all content you provide to the Minovative Mind extension, including text prompts, selected code, uploaded images (processed as Base64 data), and URLs. You are also solely responsible for reviewing, verifying, and deploying any code, plans, or other outputs generated by the AI. You acknowledge that AI-generated content may be inaccurate, incomplete, or contain errors, and you must exercise your own judgment and expertise when utilizing such output.

### 3.3 Acceptable Use

You agree to use the Minovative Mind extension in compliance with all applicable local, national, and international laws and regulations. You further agree to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), which outlines expectations for respectful and collaborative engagement. Prohibited uses include, but are not limited to:

- Using the Extension for any illegal, harmful, or unethical activities.
- Generating or promoting content that is infringing, defamatory, obscene, or harmful.
- Attempting to circumvent any security features or access unauthorized data.
- Using the Extension to generate malicious code or engage in hacking activities.

### 3.4 Local Data and Environment Security

The Minovative Mind extension primarily operates on your local machine and processes your workspace data locally. You are responsible for the security of your local development environment, including your VS Code installation, project files, and network connections. We are not responsible for any security breaches or data loss originating from your local environment.

### 3.5 Autonomous AI Risks

Minovative Mind includes "Autonomous" and "Self-Correction" features that can create, modify, or delete files without per-action confirmation when these modes are active. By using these features, you acknowledge and agree that:

- **No Manual Confirmation**: The AI may make multiple changes in rapid succession without waiting for your distinct approval for each step.
- **Version Control Requirement**: You are solely responsible for ensuring your project is under version control (e.g., Git) and that you have a clean working state _before_ initiating any autonomous workflow.
- **Data Safety**: Ward Innovations DBA is not liable for any data loss, file corruption, or "regressions" (breaking of previously working code) resulting from the AI's autonomous actions.

## 4. Intellectual Property Rights

### 4.1 Extension’s Intellectual Property

The Minovative Mind VS Code extension, including its software, architecture, design, and documentation (excluding third-party components and libraries), is the intellectual property of Ward Innovations DBA and is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE.md). You agree not to reproduce, distribute, modify, or create derivative works of the Extension’s core components beyond the scope permitted by the Apache 2.0 License.

### 4.2 User Content and AI-Generated Output

You retain all intellectual property rights to the code, data, and other content you input into the Minovative Mind extension. For content generated by the AI in response to your prompts, you typically own the output in the same way you would own content you create using other software tools, subject to any limitations imposed by the Google Gemini API’s terms of service and any applicable copyright laws. You are responsible for ensuring that your input and any AI-generated output comply with relevant intellectual property laws.

## 5. Data Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. The Minovative Mind extension is designed with an emphasis on local processing and user control. Please refer to our comprehensive [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY_POLICY.md) for detailed information on how your data is processed, handled, and protected when you use the Extension. Key aspects include:

- Most data, including your local workspace files and API key, is processed and stored locally on your machine.
- Your inputs (prompts, code, images, URLs) are securely transmitted to the Google Gemini API for processing as part of its core functionality, but not to Ward Innovations DBA' servers.
- Ward Innovations DBA does not collect personal usage data or analytics from you.
