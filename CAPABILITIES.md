## 2. Autonomous AI Workflows & Code Transformation

Minovative Mind can autonomously plan and execute complex development tasks, significantly accelerating your coding process and transforming code.

### 2.1 AI Planning & Execution

- **High-Level Goal Execution**: Provide a high-level objective, and the AI will generate a structured, multi-step plan to achieve it.
- **Automated Workflow**: The AI executes its plan by creating new files, writing and modifying code, and running shell commands (`create_directory`, `create_file`, `modify_file`, `run_command`).
- **Intelligent Command Escalation**: Commands like `/fix` or general code edits can automatically escalate to a full plan execution when task complexity warrants it.
- **Confirmation & Monitoring**: You'll be prompted for confirmation before a plan executes, and you can monitor its progress through real-time VS Code notifications, with options to cancel specific ongoing tasks.

### 2.2 Intelligent Code Modification

- **Flexible Scope**: The AI can refactor, edit, or modify either selected code snippets or the entire active file based on your instructions.
- **Symbol-Aware Context**: Leverages detailed symbol information (functions, classes, types) from your codebase to ensure accurate and contextually relevant modifications.
- **Quality & Production-Ready Code**: Generates modular, maintainable, and production-ready code, often using diff analysis to validate output quality.
- **Output Validation**: Employs sophisticated heuristics to sanitize and validate AI-generated code snippets, ensuring functional and high-quality output.
- **Full File Regeneration**: For code modifications, the AI regenerates the full file content, ensuring comprehensive and consistent changes.

### 2.3 Code Streaming

- **Live Generation**: Code generated by AI (for `create_file` and `modify_file` steps) is streamed character-by-character directly into the editor.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Provides immediate visual feedback during AI plan execution, making the process transparent and engaging.

### 2.4 Integrated Git Automation

- **Automated Commit Messages**: Use the `/commit` command to have the AI analyze your staged changes and generate insightful, descriptive Git commit messages.
- **Review & Edit**: The AI prompts you to review and edit the generated message before committing.

## 3. Deep Code & Project Understanding

Minovative Mind builds a profound understanding of your project to provide highly relevant and accurate AI assistance.

### 3.1 Comprehensive Context Awareness

- **Rich Data Integration**: Integrates various contextual data points, including VS Code diagnostics, user selection, document symbols, and code references.
- **Dynamic Memory Updates**: Tracks recent changes in the workspace to continually update the AI's contextual understanding.
- **External Content Processing**: Extracts and processes content directly from URLs or linked files, enhancing its comprehension and actionability.

### 3.2 Workspace & Project Analysis

- **Efficient Workspace Scanning**: Utilizes an intelligent workspace scanner with filtering to quickly identify and process relevant project files, respecting `.gitignore` rules.
- **Symbol & Dependency Graphing**: Builds a comprehensive symbol tree and provides persistent, cached workspace-wide dependency graphs, enabling deep, context-aware analysis and type resolution.

### 3.3 Intelligent File Relevance Engine

- **Hybrid File Selection**: Employs a combination of heuristic (rule-based) and AI-driven (smart) selection strategies to identify the most relevant files for context.
- **Prioritized Context**: Prioritizes files that are recently modified, linked by symbols, or are directly related to the user's active context, with refined relevance scoring considering file dependency graphs.
- **Intelligent File Summarization**: Summarizes file content to fit within token limits while preserving critical information, including detailed file complexity estimation and enhanced main purpose detection.
- **Configurable Heuristic Selection**: Utilizes configurable rules (e.g., directory proximity, dependency analysis, symbol relevance) for intelligent file selection.
- **Dependency Extraction**: Performs expanded and refined dependency extraction directly from code, enriching file summaries.

### 3.4 Resilient Context Construction

- **Large Project Handling**: Designed to efficiently handle large projects by strategically skipping oversized files (e.g., 1MB+ files).
- **Intelligent File Exclusion**: Automatically excludes binary files and adheres to `.gitignore` rules to optimize context and avoid irrelevant data.
- **Language Detection**: Includes robust language detection for files without extensions, ensuring accurate context formatting for the AI.

## 4. Reliability, Control & Transparency

Minovative Mind prioritizes user control, project security, and transparent operation.

### 4.1 User Control & Transparency

- **Real-time Progress Indicators**: Provides constant, visible feedback on ongoing AI tasks using VS Code notifications.
- **Cancellable Tasks**: Supports cancellation of most AI-driven tasks via `CancellationToken`, allowing users to interrupt long-running operations.
- **Transparent UI Updates**: Ensures all UI changes and cancellations are clearly communicated and reflected in the extension's interface.
- **Seamless State Restoration**: Preserves and restores critical extension states (e.g., pending plans, active AI operations, user preferences) across VS Code restarts for continuity.

### 4.2 Security & Filesystem Safety

- **Workspace-Bound Operations**: All file system modifications and creations are strictly confined to the user's active VS Code workspace directory, preventing unintended changes outside the project scope.
- **Shell Command Approval**: Requires explicit user confirmation for every `run_command` step within an AI-generated plan. Users have the power to allow, skip, or cancel individual execution steps.

### 4.3 Reversible Changes & Auditing

- **Project Change Logging**: Accurately tracks all file system changes (additions, modifications, deletions) made by AI-driven workflows.
- **Reversible AI Plans**: Enables safe experimentation by allowing users to easily revert entire AI plans with a dedicated button.

- **Real-time Token Usage Display**: Provides immediate feedback on token usage directly within the sidebar.

### 4.5 Error Handling & Diagnostics

- **Context Fallback Strategy**: Implements a layered fallback mechanism for context building (smart → heuristic → minimal) to ensure AI always receives some relevant information.
- **Real-time Status Feedback**: Provides clear status feedback on the progress of plan generation and context building to the user.
- **Error and Diff Highlighting**: Highlights errors and code differences in the UI for quick identification and review.
