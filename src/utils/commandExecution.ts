/**
 * Executes a command, captures its stdout and stderr, and handles cancellation.
 * It adds the spawned child process to a provided tracking array (`activeChildProcesses`)
 * immediately and removes it upon the command's completion (success, failure, or cancellation).
 *
 * @param {string} command - The command to execute (e.g., "npm").
 * @param {string[]} args - An array of string arguments for the command (e.g., ["install"]).
 * @param {string} cwd - The current working directory for the command execution.
 * @param {vscode.CancellationToken} token - A VS Code CancellationToken to observe for cancellation requests.
 * @param {ChildProcess[]} activeChildProcesses - An array to which the spawned ChildProcess will be added
 *   and from which it will be removed. This allows for global management of active child processes.
 * @param {vscode.Terminal} [vscodeTerminal] - An optional VS Code terminal. This argument is accepted for compatibility but is ignored, as output piping is now suppressed.
 * @returns {Promise<CommandResult>} A Promise that resolves with an object containing
 *   `stdout`, `stderr`, and `exitCode`. The Promise will reject only if the command
 *   fails to spawn (e.g., command not found, permissions error).
 *
 * @remarks
 * - This function explicitly avoids `shell: true` for security reasons. Ensure the `command`
 *   and `args` are properly escaped if they originate from untrusted user input before
 *   being passed to this function, although passing `args` separately mitigates many shell injection risks.
 * - If the command is cancelled, it will be killed via `child.kill()` (SIGTERM). The `exitCode`
 *   in this scenario might be `null` or a specific non-zero value (e.g., 130 for SIGTERM on Linux).
